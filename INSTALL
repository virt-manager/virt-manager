  Basic Install
  =============

For starters, if you just want to run virt-manager/virt-install to test out
changes, it can be done from the source directory:

    ./virt-manager

To install the software into /usr/local (usually), you can do:

    python setup.py install

To build an RPM, you can run:

    python setup.py rpm

setup.py generally has all the build and install commands, for more info see:

    python setup.py --help-commands
    python setup.py install --help
    http://docs.python.org/inst/standard-install.html


  Pre-requisite software
  ======================

virt-manager was ported to GTK3 at the beginning of 2013. Older GTK3
or pygobject3 versions likely will not work for running virt-manager.

Earliest tested versions of major components:

  python >= 2.6
  gtk3 >= 3.6
  libvirt-python >= 0.4.0
  pygobject3 >= 3.4
  libosinfo >= 0.2.10

A more detailed dependency list can be found in virt-manager.spec.in. On
Debian based distributions you need to install the gobject-introspection
bindings for some depedencies like libvirt-glib and libosinfo. Look for
package names that start with 'gir'.
