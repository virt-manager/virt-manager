=head1 NAME

virt-clone - clone existing virtual machine images

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<virt-clone> [OPTION]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<virt-clone> is a command line tool for cloning existing virtual machine
images using the C<libvirt> hypervisor management library. It will copy
the disk images of any existing virtual machine, and define a new guest
with an identical virtual hardware configuration. Elements which require
uniqueness will be updated to avoid a clash between old and new guests.

By default, virt-clone will show an error if the necessary information to
clone the guest is not provided. The --auto-clone option will generate
all needed input, aside from the source guest to clone. An interactive mode
is available with the --prompt option, but this will only ask for the
minimum required options.

=head1 OPTIONS

Most options are not required. Minimum requirements are --original or
--original-xml (to specify the guest to clone), --name, and appropriate
storage options via -file.

=over 4

=item -h, --help

Show the help message and exit

=item  --connect=URI

Connect to a non-default hypervisor. See L<virt-install(1)> for details

=back

=head2 General Options

General configuration parameters that apply to all guest clones.

=over 2

=item -o ORIGINAL_GUEST, --original=ORIGINAL_GUEST

Name of the original guest to be cloned. This guest must be shut off or paused
since it is not possible to safely clone active guests at this time.

=item --original-xml=ORIGINAL_XML

Libvirt guest xml file to use as the original guest. The guest does not need to
be defined on the libvirt connection. This takes the place of the
C<--original> parameter.

=item --auto-clone

Generate a new guest name, and paths for new storage.

An example or possible generated output:

  Original name        : MyVM
  Generated clone name : MyVM-clone

  Original disk path   : /home/user/foobar.img
  Generated disk path  : /home/user/foobar-clone.img

If generated names collide with existing VMs or storage, a number is appended,
such as foobar-clone-1.img, or MyVM-clone-3.

=item -n NAME, --name=NAME

Name of the new guest virtual machine instance. This must be unique amongst
all guests known to the hypervisor connection, including those not
currently active.

=item -u UUID, --uuid=UUID

UUID for the guest; if none is given a random UUID will be generated. If you
specify UUID, you should use a 32-digit hexadecimal number. UUID are intended
to be unique across the entire data center, and indeed world. Bear this in
mind if manually specifying a UUID

=back

=head2 Storage Configuration

=over 2

=item -f DISKFILE, --file=DISKFILE

Path to the file, disk partition, or logical volume to use as the backing store
for the new guest's virtual disk. If the original guest has multiple disks,
this parameter must be repeated multiple times, once per disk in the original
virtual machine.

=item --force-copy=TARGET

Force cloning the passed disk target ('hdc', 'sda', etc.). By default,
C<virt-clone> will skip certain disks, such as those marked 'readonly' or
'shareable'.

=item --nonsparse

Fully allocate the new storage if the path being cloned is a sparse file.
See L<virt-install(1)> for more details on sparse vs. nonsparse.

=item --preserve-data

No storage is cloned: disk images specific by --file are preserved as is,
and referenced in the new clone XML. This is useful if you want to clone
a VM XML template, but not the storage contents.

=back

=head2 Networking Configuration

=over 2

=item -m MAC, --mac=MAC

Fixed MAC address for the guest; If this parameter is omitted, or the value
C<RANDOM> is specified a suitable address will be randomly generated. Addresses
are applied sequentially to the networks as they are listed in the original
guest XML.

=back

=head2 Miscellaneous Options

=over 2

=item --print-xml

Print the generated clone XML and exit without cloning.

=item --replace

Shutdown and remove any existing guest with the passed C<--name> before
cloning the original guest.

=item -d, --debug

Print debugging information to the terminal when running the install process.
The debugging information is also stored in C<$HOME/.virtinst/virt-clone.log>
even if this parameter is omitted.

=item --force

Prevent interactive prompts. If the intended prompt was a yes/no prompt, always
say yes. For any other prompts, the application will exit.

=item --prompt

Specifically enable prompting for required information. Default prompting
is off.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Clone the guest called C<demo> on the default connection, auto generating
a new name and disk clone path.

  # virt-clone \
       --original demo \
       --auto-clone

Clone the guest called C<demo> which has a single disk to copy

  # virt-clone \
       --original demo \
       --name newdemo \
       --file /var/lib/xen/images/newdemo.img

Clone a QEMU guest with multiple disks

  # virt-clone \
       --connect qemu:///system \
       --original demo \
       --name newdemo \
       --file /var/lib/xen/images/newdemo.img \
       --file /var/lib/xen/images/newdata.img

Clone a guest to a physical device which is at least as big as the
original guests disks. If the destination device is bigger, the
new guest can do a filesystem resize when it boots.

  # virt-clone \
       --connect qemu:///system \
       --original demo \
       --name newdemo \
       --file /dev/HostVG/DemoVM \
       --mac 52:54:00:34:11:54
