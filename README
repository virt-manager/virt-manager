 Virtual Machine Manager
 =======================

This application provides a graphical tool for managing virtual machines
via the libvirt library.

The front end of the application uses the PyGTK / Glade libraries for
all user interaction components. The back end uses libvirt for managing
Xen, QEMU & KVM virtual machines. The UI is primarily tested with Xen
and QEMU, but is intended to be portable to any virtualization backend
libvirt supports. So when libvirt is ported to UML / VMware / etc the
UI should not require any significant changes to deal with these drivers.

Terminology
-----------

In prose this app should be referred to as 'Virtual Machine Manager'.
For source / RPM packaging, & the command name, it is called by the
shortened form 'virt-manager'

Basic Install
-------------

To build virt-manager, run the command:

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

You can then run virt-manager in the source directory with

    python src/virt-manager.py

To install the software into /usr/local (usually), you can then run:

    make install

To build an RPM, you can run:

    make rpm

virt-manager generally requires the latest upstream version of
python-virtinst, which checked out with

git clone git://git.fedorahosted.org/git/python-virtinst.git

If you want to replace your system installed virt-manager version,
add --prefix=/usr to ./configure. Please see the INSTALL file
for much more information about autotools install options.

Submitting patches
------------------

Patches should be submitted either as unified diffs:

   tar zxvf virt-manager-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
   cp -a virt-manager-X.Y.Z virt-manager-X.Y.Z-myfeature
   cd virt-manager-X.Y.Z-myfeature
   ... make some changes ..
   cd ..
   diff -ruN virt-manager-X.Y.Z virt-manager-X.Y.Z-myfeature \
      > myfeature.patch

Alternatively use git and submit a diff against the main source repository:

   git clone git://git.fedorahosted.org/git/virt-manager.git
   cd virt-manager
   ... make your changes ...
   git commit -a -m "Some changelog message"
   git show > my_feature.patch

Then mail the 'my_feature.patch' file to the virt-tools-list@redhat.com list,
with [PATCH] and a brief description in the subject.

Using git format-patch and/or git send-email is also fine.
