 Virtual Machine Manager
 =======================

This application provides a graphical tool for managing virtual machines
via the libvirt library.

The front end of the application uses the PyGTK / Glade libraries for
all user interaction components. The back end uses libvirt for managing
Xen, QEMU & KVM virtual machines. The UI is primarily tested with Xen
and QEMU, but is intended to be portable to any virtualization backend 
libvirt supports. So when libvirt is ported to UML / VmWare / etc the 
UI should not require any significant changes to deal with these drivers.

Terminology
-----------

In prose this app should be referred to as 'Virtual Machine Manager'.
For source / RPM packaging, & the command name, it is called by the
shortened form 'virt-manager'

Pre-requisite software
----------------------

Where versions are noted below these are the versions tested to definitely
work. For some of them you may be able to run with earlier releases, so
please report any success to the mailing lists 

 python  >= 2.4
 pygtk2 >= 1.99.12-6
 gnome-python2-gconf >= 1.99.11-7
 libvirt-python >= 0.2.1
 dbus-python >= 0.61
 gnome-keyring >= 0.4.9
 gnome-python-desktop >= 2.15.4
 libxml2-python >= 2.6.23
 vte >= 0.12.2
 python-virtinst >= 0.103.0

The latter is available from

Contact
-------

All comments / suggestions / patches should be directed to the fedora-xen
mailing list:

  http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/fedora-xen

There are futher project details on the website:

Submitting patches
------------------

Patches should be submitted either as unified diffs:

   tar zxvf virt-manager-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
   cp -a virt-manager-X.Y.Z virt-manager-X.Y.Z-myfeature
   cd virt-manager-X.Y.Z-myfeature
   ... make some changes .. 
   cd ..
   diff -ruN virt-manager-X.Y.Z virt-manager-X.Y.Z-myfeature \
      > myfeature.patch

Alternatively use Mercurial and submit a changeset bundle against
the main source repository:

   hg clone  http://hg.et.redhat.com/virt/applications/virt-manager--devel
   cd virt-manager--devel
   ... make some changes & commit them locally...
   hg bundle myfeature.hg http://hg.et.redhat.com/virt/applications/virt-manager--devel

Then mail the 'myfeature.hg' file to fedora-xen list. This approach is
preferred to plain patches, because the Mercurial bundle preserves all
your local commit messages & history.
