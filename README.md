# Virtual Machine Manager

`virt-manager` is a graphical tool for managing virtual machines
via [libvirt](https://libvirt.org). Most usage is with QEMU/KVM
virtual machines, but Xen and libvirt LXC containers are well
supported. Common operations for any libvirt driver should work.

Several command line tools are also provided:

- `virt-install`: Create new libvirt virtual machines
- `virt-clone`: Duplicate existing libvirt virtual machines
- `virt-xml`: Edit existing libvirt virtual machines/manipulate libvirt XML

For dependency info and installation instructions, see the
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.
Once you have all the pre-requisite dependencies installed,
if you just want to quickly test the code from a git checkout,
you can launch any of the commands like:

```sh
./virt-manager --debug ...
```
